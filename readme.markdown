## This project you see not!

Farleyfile is an information management system that uses Lokad.CQRS with a dash of event sourcing, DDD and "cloud magic".

Unlike other CQRS samples I'm developing it for real use in helping me to manage my notes, ideas, articles and projects (read about [Farley File](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farley_File)). 

Currently I'm still evolving the functionality and features (stories, contexts, note management etc). Because of that, the actual codebase might be a little bit confusing and hacky - not suitable for learning or presenting concepts of Lokad.CQRS (i.e.: aggregate roots and tests are messed up).

So if you accidentally stumble across this project, I recommend to avoid diving into it right now. This could make everything feel much more complex than it actually is. Besides, there are a few really cool features I'll be adding only towards the end (to keep the surprise :) Some of the design choices will not make a lot of sense till then.

Publishing of this sample is planned closer towards the end of August - beginning of September, when we'll be releasing v3 refresh of Lokad.CQRS.

Meanwhile, you can just enjoy the summer and stay tuned to my blog abdullin.com. You can also grab a copy of DDD book by Eric Evans, practice vim or check out LMAX implementations.
